	<p class="heading"><strong><u>METHOD OF EVALUATION</u></strong></p>

<p>Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation is done throughout the year as per Central Board norms. Grades are awarded. Students are graded in everything they do. For Std. X there would be no board examination. Those children wanting to do an examination at the Std. X level could do an on-line pen and paper examination. However, the Board Examination for Std. XII takes place at the end of the academic year.</p>

<p>The Central Board of Secondary Education has introduced Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation for Class IX during the academic year 2009-10</p>

<p>The evaluation consists of six phases during the year:</p>

<p><strong><u>First Term</u></strong></p>
<p>Formative Assessment I  10%</p>
<p>Formative Assessment II  10%</p>
<p>Summative Assessment I  20%</p>

<p><strong><u>Second Term</u></strong></p>
<p>Formative Assessment III  10%</p>
<p>Formative Assessment IV  10%</p>
<p>Summative Assessment II  40%</p>

<p>Only grades will be entered in the CCE record as mentioned below:</p>
<pre>
<p>91-100                 A1
81-90                   A2
71-80                   B1
61-70                   B2
51-60                   C1
41-50                   C2
33-40                   D
21-32                   E1
00-20                   E2</p>
</pre>
<p><strong><u>Formative Assessment</u></strong> consists of Projects, Quizzes, Research Work, Assignment, and class interactions. <strong><u>Summative Assessment</u></strong> consists of multiple choice questions (MCQ), short answer and long answer questions from the portions of that term. The same system will be followed for Class X in the next academic year. There will not be any Board Examination for Class X. On the other hand the passing of Class X depends on the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation records. If after the Class X level, a student is seeking admission to Class XI in a CBSE school this record is sufficient. However, if a student wants to go to another Board, he or she should appear for the on-line pen and paper examination at the end of Class X. The board examination will be held at the end of Class XII.</p> 

<p>Individual attention is given to each child and his/her progress assessed. Special coaching classes are arranged wherever necessary.</p>
